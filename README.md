# Game "Life or mine"
This is a console game, which I did for my university. So this is lab1.
The main idea of this game is to reach the lower right corner.
I was using a multidimensional array for a field and movement was realised by WASD.
On the field there are mines and health which are generated randomly. 
You set the size of the field and the amount of health.
